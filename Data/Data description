There are two iamge volumes. One is our own dataset and the other is a oublic dataset.

PyramidalNeuronSubBlock.tif is a volume with a size of 981x786x457 (0.2 um x 0.2 um x 1.0 um). 677MB
PyramidalNeuronSubBlock.swc is a sub-axon-tree in the volume.
This dataset is imaged by Wuhan National Laboratory for
Optoelectronics-Huazhong University of Science and Technology
Details of the data acquiring can be found in [1].


DL1AS2Gr.tif, DL1AS2Gr_Trace1.swc, DL1AS2Gr_Trace1_0.2um.swc and DL1AS2Gr_Trace1_0.26um.swc 
This datset is a public dataset from Gala et al. ( http://www.northeastern.edu/neurogeometry/resources/bouton-analyzer/)
The size is 1024 x 1204 x 150 (0.26 um x 0.26 um x 0.8 um). 256MB
DL1AS2Gr_Trace1.swc is a axon trace in the volume with uint voxel.
DL1AS2Gr_Trace1_0.2um.swc or DL1AS2Gr_Trace1_0.26um.swc is the same trace with an uint of micrometer (um). 
When testing this datset with DL1AS2Gr_Trace1_0.2um.swc , please fill in the xyzRes = [0.2 0.2 1] in the main_sub_block.m
When testing this datset with DL1AS2Gr_Trace1_0.26um.swc , please fill in the xyzRes = [0.26 0.26 1] in the main_sub_block.m 
Both are ok.
